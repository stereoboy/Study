    "## Tracking Emerges by Colorizing Videos\n",
    "* Google Research, 2018\n",
    "### Main Strategy\n",
    "* Use large amounts of unlabeled video to learn models for visual tracking\n",
    "  * Without manual human supervision. \n",
    "* Colorization\n",
    "  * We leverage the natural temporal coherency of color to create a model that learns to colorize gray-scale videos by copying colors from a reference frame.\n",
    "  * Quantitative and qualitative experiments suggest that this task causes the model to automatically learn to track visual regions.\n",
    "* Outperform Optical flow\n",
    "  * Although the model is trained without any ground-truth labels, our method learns to track well enough to outperform optical flow based methods.\n",
    "* Advancing Colorization\n",
    "  * Our results suggest that failures to track are correlated with failures to colorize, indicating that advancing video colorization may further improve self-supervised visual tracking."
